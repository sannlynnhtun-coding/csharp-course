## 💡 C\# vs .NET

| C\# 💻 | .NET 🛡️ |
|----|------|
| C\# is a programming language that is primarily used for building .NET applications. | .NET is a framework for building different kinds of programming applications. |
| Since it has similar syntax and concepts with Java, JavaScript, and it is easier to learn C\#. | Open-source many languages (C\#, F\#, VB.NET), libraries, ecosystems with multiple platforms (Heroku, IBM Bluemix) are available for your use. |
| Being Microsoft products, benefit from extensive support from the MSDN community. | It is harder to learn since it has a broad selection of various types of technologies to have as background and lots of community support. |
| Provides the syntax and rules for coding. | Does not also have support from the MSDN community. It also provides the environment for executing applications written in C\#, or other compatible languages. |
| Used to develop cross-platform desktop, web frameworks, service application, and statement keyword. | It's a framework with an extensive library of pre-existing classes ready to be utilized right away. |
| In C\#, the Common Language Runtime (CLR) ensures complete applications. | .NET framework includes runtime environment (CLR) and a class library that developers use as code libraries into their applications. |
| Supports multi-paradigm programming (OOP after encapsulation inheritance language including LEC & function). | This supports a wide range of programming paradigms, especially with its IL through the combination of compilation and interpretation processes. .NET uses Framework \# emphasizing practicality in its programming languages like F\# for building efficient programs within this structure system. |
